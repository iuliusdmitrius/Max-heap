# Max-heap
My realization of priority queue.

It takes a number of operation n, and each of following n strings sets an operation of one of the next two types:
- Insert x, where x is an integer
- ExtractMax.
The first operation adds x to the priority queue, the second operation extracts the maximum number and prints it to console.
